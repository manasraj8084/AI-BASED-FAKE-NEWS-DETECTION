# Fake News Detection

This project uses machine learning to detect fake news based on textual data. It uses Logistic Regression and TF-IDF for classification.

## Dataset
Use the `news.csv` file from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset).

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python fake_news_detector.py
    ```

## Output
The script prints accuracy and allows you to test news examples manually.
